Personal [[https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs][spacemacs]] layer. Color settings are lying in a messy state in
~./config.el~, which are defined as overrides over themes ~spacemacs-light~ (light
theme) and ~doom-molokai~ (dark theme). All other configuration is split across
/packages/ (see directory ~./local/~) named ~r-*~ and corresponding init fuctions in
~./packages.el~.

It looks something like the screens below (might not be updated).
